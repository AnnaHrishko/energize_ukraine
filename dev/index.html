						<p>We are urgently seeking assistance to source critical equipment. While they will be challenged over the medium to long term to rebuild their electricity system, their current requirements are immediate and extremely urgent: under constant threats of missile attacks, they need to cobble sufficient materials together to survive the winter.  Ukraine is facing almost daily bombing and cruise missile attacks by Russia, mainly targeting electricity infrastructure. Many parts of Ukraine are in the dark and others face rolling blackouts.</p>

						<p>Attached is information concerning the urgent and immediate need for critical supplies. Previous concerns about incompatibility of equipment due to difference in frequency or voltage are no longer an issue. They have workarounds, and are prepared, given the urgency, to adapt where required. Thus, they will gladly accept 60hz equipment, and their most urgent need is for transmission autotransformers. Their voltage classes on the transmission system, and acceptable equipment they can adapt are:</p>
